This is documentation for the shiny application.

This application takes some parameters of a Gaussian laser beam and uses it to calculate the beam width as a function of distance.

The beam waist is the width of the beam at the focal point of the beam in millimeters, and can be measured. 

The wavelength corresponds to the wavelength of the laser in nanometers. Common laser wavelengths are green at 532nm, and red at 633nm.

The propagation distance is the distane in millimeters after the focal point. It is at this point that the beam width is calculated in millimeters.  

To use the application simply enetr in the parameters and hit submit and the beam width will be calculated at the given propagation distance.
